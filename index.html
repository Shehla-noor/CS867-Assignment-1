Basic Image Analysis Operations

### 2.1
Load the set of images and display them as Grayscale and rgb images.
### 2.2
Implement the function rgbExclusion() in the helper script, in which the input image is decomposed into the three channels: R, G and B and return the image excluding the specified channel. Display the results in notebook.
### 2.3
Take at-least 3 images from given set and plot histograms before and after applying histogram equalization.
### 2.4
Implement the convolution operation (sharpening and blurring effects) from scratch. Compare the results of the implemented function with the ones available (built-in) in python packages.
### 2.5
Load a couple of images from the given set.
1.	Apply box filter using convolution, and display the resultant image
2.	Apply Gaussian filter to the image, with varying sigma values.
3.	Add Gausian Noise and Salt and Pepper Noise to them.
4.	Apply Gaussian Filter and Median Filters.
5.	Display mesh plots for: i) Gaussian filters ii) First Order Derivative of Gaussian iii) Laplacian of Gaussian; using different sigma values.
### 2.6
Load a few images from the given set.
1.	Apply Sobel operator, computer gradient magnitude and display the results.
2.	Apply Laplacian of Gaussian, computer laplacian magnitude and display the results.
2.7 Bonus Question
Implement Canny Edge detector from scratch or use built-in function from python packages, and apply it on a real time video/stream.
